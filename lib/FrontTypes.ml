   terminal symbol either is a normal identifier [LID], in which case it is
   the name of the terminal symbol, or is a quoted identifier [QID], in which
   case it is a token alias.

   Token aliases are eliminated by replacing them with the corresponding
   terminal symbols very early on during the joining of the partial grammars;
   see the module [ExpandTokenAliases].

   In a complete grammar, there are no token aliases any longer. That is,
   we keep track of the aliases that have been declared (they can be found
   via the field [tk_alias]), but we never use them, since they have been
   eliminated up front. *)

   level of the form [PrecedenceLevel (file, level)], where [file]
   is an input file and [level] is an integer level. Within each file, later
   declarations receive greater levels, which represent higher priority. Two
   declarations that originate in different files are incomparable. *)
