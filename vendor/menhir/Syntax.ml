(**This module defines the abstract syntax of Menhir's input files, whose
   extension is [.mly].

   The type [partial_grammar] describes the abstract syntax of a partial
   grammar, that is, just a fragment of a grammar. This syntax is produced by
   the parser. An [.mly] file represents a partial grammar. Several partial
   grammars can be joined so as to obtain a complete grammar.

   The type [grammar] describes the abstract syntax of a complete grammar. It
   differs from [partial_grammar] in that declarations are organized in a more
   useful way and a number of well-formedness checks have been performed. *)

(* -------------------------------------------------------------------------- *)

(**Attributes allow the user to annotate the grammar with information that is
   ignored by Menhir, but can be exploited by other tools, via the SDK. *)

(**Attributes can be attached in the following places:

   - with the grammar:         %[@bar ...]
   - with a terminal symbol:   %token FOO [@bar ...]
   - with a rule:              foo(X) [@bar ...]: ...
   - with a production:        e = expr { e } [@bar ...]
   - with a producer:          e = foo(quux) [@bar ...]
   - with an arbitrary symbol: %attribute FOO foo(quux) [@bar ...]

   After expanding away parameterized nonterminal symbols, things become
   a bit simpler, as %attribute declarations are desugared away. *)

(**The old rule syntax. Although old, still used internally. The new syntax
   is translated down to it. *)

(**A parameter is either a symbol or an application of a symbol to a
   nonempty tuple of parameters. These two cases correspond to the
   constructors [ParamVar] and [ParamApp].

   Although it might seem tempting to fuse these constructors into one, one
   must not do so. Indeed, every application must have sort [*], whereas a
   variable can have an arbitrary sort. Therefore, a variable should not be
   viewed as an application of a variable to zero arguments.

   Before anonymous rules have been eliminated, a parameter can also be
   an anonymous rule, represented as a list of branches. *)

  | ParamVar of symbol located
  | ParamApp of symbol located * parameters
  | ParamAnonymous of parameterized_branch list located

and parameters =

(**A producer is a pair of identifier and a parameter. In concrete syntax, it
   could be [e = expr], for instance. The identifier [e] is always present.
   (A use of the keyword [$i] in a semantic action is turned by the lexer
   and parser into a reference to an identifier [_i].) A producer carries
   a number of attributes. *)
and producer =
  identifier located * parameter * attributes

(**A branch (the right-hand side of a production) is a sequence of producers
   followed with a semantic action. *)

(**In the user's eyes, the new rule syntax replaces (or complements)
   the old rule syntax, which corresponds to the types [parameter],
   [producer], [parameterized_branch], and [parameterized_rule]
   above. *)

(**Internally, the new rule syntax is translated down to the old rule
   syntax; see the module [NewRuleSyntax]. This is done on the fly
   during parsing. *)

   The differences with partial grammars (above) are as follows:

   2. there can be several postludes.
   3. declarations are organized by kind: preludes, postludes,
      functor %parameters, %start symbols, %types, %tokens, %on_error_reduce,
      grammar attributes, %attributes.
   4. rules are stored in a map, indexed by symbol names, instead of a list.
   5. token aliases have been replaced with ordinary named terminal symbols. *)
